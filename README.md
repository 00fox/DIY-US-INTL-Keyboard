# DIY-US-INTL-Keyboard
Not revolutionary, but a much easier way to arrange an international layout on US keyboard than usual solutions. Especially for programmers.

I will complete the project step by step

The story:

When inventing the Morse code, Samuel wondered what were the most used letters in order to match the alphabet to the code, the simplest for the most used. Then for the hesitations between two, the most visual, association of form or idea, simple memotechnical means.
These are the basics of mechanical writing. And this is what we are going to try to find, where we got lost, keeping this essential in mind and trying to avoid the pitfalls of other solutions that seem to be advantageous. And find there a certain joy of living without contradiction with efficiency.

Historically, this would have gone something like this:



If I add in 4 colors the most used letters, it gives this:



We see that to avoid distances, the letters were grouped on the same side, then, the least important of the most important, on the left, next to the capitals keys.
Of course in other languages, the letters FGB for example are more used, but overall the classification remains the same.
Now let's put them in order of importance, on a newer machine keyboard that requires less keystrokes and space, ergonomically; yes, we come from there; therefore eight fingers placed in a rounded shape on the middle line of the layout.



Which fingers are the most significant for each letter, balance of importance, ideas: the words east and black.



Now the ease of access, to associate with which side for each pair (letter rather analytical or letter rather synthetic or balance) and to the order of importance of the letters, which is: EARIOTNSLCUDMPHGBFYWKVXZJQ



- Nowadays perhaps MP and HG would be interchangeable given that there is less space to cover and therefore less intellectualization of a vertical line change compared to a somewhat difficult finger advancement.
- This is the first draft of the qwerty/qwertz/azerty we know, some say one is scientific, the other universal, that's wrong, both are scientific and universal, the difference just depends on how the machine, and the need to adapt to avoid fatigue.
- The problems: (yes, we made this mistake again later) rather than punctuation and accentuation keys being on the same keys as the letters, we wanted them independent and easy to access, at least for the comma; the point only being placed at the end of the line. So the comma instead of the L and the point to its right. Also you could transfer the little used X to the other side.
