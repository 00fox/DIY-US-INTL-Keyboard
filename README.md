# DIY-US-INTL-Keyboard
Not revolutionary, but a much easier way to arrange an international layout on US keyboard than usual solutions. Especially for programmers.

I will complete the project step by step

The story:

When inventing the Morse code, Samuel wondered what were the most used letters in order to match the alphabet to the code, the simplest for the most used. Then for the hesitations between two, the most visual, association of form or idea, simple memotechnical means.
These are the basics of mechanical writing. And this is what we are going to try to find, where we got lost, keeping this essential in mind and trying to avoid the pitfalls of other solutions that seem to be advantageous. And find there a certain joy of living without contradiction with efficiency.

Historically, this would have gone something like this:



If I add in 4 colors the most used letters, it gives this:



Of course in other languages, the letters FGB for example are more used, but overall the classification remains the same.
Now let's put them in order of importance, on a newer machine keyboard that requires less keystrokes and space, ergonomically; yes, we come from there; therefore eight fingers placed in a rounded shape on the middle line of the layout.
